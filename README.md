# CriticalPathAnalyzer

## Description

CriticalPathAnalyzer is a Python-based tool designed to automate the identification of critical paths in project schedules. Utilizing a graph representation of tasks, durations, and dependencies, this application implements the Bellman-Ford algorithm to efficiently determine the maximum time required to complete a project.

## Features

- Load project data from CSV files.
- Visualize task dependencies as a directed graph.
- Calculate the critical path and minimum project completion time.
- Easily adaptable for various project structures and requirements.
